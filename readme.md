## 🎯 Overview

AudioMCQ is a comprehensive audio multiple-choice question dataset with **571k samples** designed for post-training Large Audio Language Models (LALMs). The dataset features dual chain-of-thought annotations and audio-contribution filtering, achieving state-of-the-art results in audio understanding tasks.

### Key Highlights

- ✅ **571k high-quality samples** across sound, music, speech, and temporal domains
- ✅ **Dual CoT annotations**: Structured and unstructured reasoning paths
- ✅ **Audio-Contribution filtering**: Weak (54.8%) and strong (45.2%) splits
- ✅ **DCASE 2025 Challenge**: 1st place winner
- ✅ **Pre-trained models available**: Weak-to-Strong and Mixed-to-Strong paradigms
